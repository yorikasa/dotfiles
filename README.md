This directory includes important configuration files.
When you (me) buy a new Mac, you will have to copy these files to the home
directory.

# How to use

Simply run `setup.sh` do the job (maybe).

# Files

- `.emacs.d`
  - emacs configuration files (will you use emacs anyway?)
- `.bashrc`
  - bash configuration file
- `.bash_profile`
  - link to `.bashrc`
- `.inputrc`
  - some terminal configuration
- `.gitconfig`
  - git configuration
- `setup.sh`
  - Copy files above to the home directory.
